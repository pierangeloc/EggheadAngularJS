2. First binding example. You can bind even class names. Type in the input box:
   - alert-box
   - panel
   
3. Created controller

4. Created 2 scopes, and 2 divs with 2 different controllers, totally separated. They are not connected. 
   To connect them, need to create a module and inject it into the scopes
   
5. Defined a method in the scope. Ideally the method doesn't use the scope directly, unless strictly required. Method can be
   referenced anywhere within the scope

6. Replaced the reverse method with a filter. Show both methods together

7. Test

8. Added an ng-filter to filter the result

9. More filters, piped together. search, orderBy, limitTo. Filters apply to lists, and there are filters applying also to strings, e.g. to uppercase/lowercase

10. First very simple directive created. It just creates a div tag whenever the directive is called, according to the specified template. It reminds me of tag libraries for jsp
